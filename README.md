# Day-51
A very simple space shooter game made with Python and Pygame library.

# How to install
To run this game you need to install Python 2.7.X x86 from https://www.python.org/downloads/.</br>
<b>Windows: during the installation, on the customization screen, scroll down, click “Add python.exe to Path,” and then select “Will be installed on local hard drive.” so you can run python from the cmd!</b></br>
Once you have installed Python, you must go to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml and download Pygame 1.9 x86 for Python 2.7, then install it, but make sure to <b>select the correct Python installation directory</b> (if you have installed it for all users the default directory is "C:\Python27")!

# Where can I download the game?
You can download it from [Itch.io](https://acevgam3.itch.io/day-51).
